<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Ethan, a musician from Oregon, living in Kansas City. I'm married to the love of my life, Megan, and we have an adorable stinky 1 year old cat named Crunchy.</p>

<p>Music creation is my life; I drum professionally at the International House Of Prayer, as well as mix the sound broadcast for their/our live streaming platforms.</p>

<p>I enjoy a compelling Xbox game narrative with a puzzle to solve, grilling steak & potatoes, and traveling to new places with my wife trying new wines and drinks.</p>

<p>The stronger the coffee the better, the more peaceful the environment the ultimate :]</p>
